    "## Insertion Sort\n",
    "Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similarly to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part. Insertion sort is fast and best suitable either when the problem size is small (because it has low overhead) or when the data is nearly sorted (because it is adaptive).\n",

The merge(A, p, q, r) is a key process that assumes that A[p..q] and A[q+1..r] are sorted and merges the two sorted sub-arrays into one.\n",
